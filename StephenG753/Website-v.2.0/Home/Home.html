						Welcome to my Personal Website. I am Stephen Giang. I am a Software Engineer at General Atomics
						with a love to the Art of Coding. This is a website to hold all of my Coding Projects, my
						Resume, a Get to Know Me Section, my Contact Information, and a link to see my Tutoring Webpage.
						Please feel free to dive into my life, and get to know me a little. Also please feel free to
						take a look at my best coding projects, and contact me if you had any ways to improve them or
						had any questions!

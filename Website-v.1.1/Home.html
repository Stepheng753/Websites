					<h1>Hello and Welcome!</h1>
					<p>
						This is my second time making a full fledges website. This website is a host for my Personal
						Projects along with simply anything I want to show the world. I have really found a great
						passion in programming, especially the web development side of it, over the past 3 years. I love
						web development because its a way for me to make visualizations of my entire programming
						journey, instead of just printing statements. One thing, I very much struggle in is being
						creative.
						<a href="../Website-v.1.0/Home.html">My first website</a> was a raw website with hardly any
						design or styling, and was purely functional. This time, through the help of my friends for
						design purposes, I made this website entirely using Vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS. Please feel free
						to navigate through my website and contact me if you have any suggestions or would like to see
						anything regarding my website. I always have an open ear for ways to make my website more
						interactive and fun.

									<h2>Education and its role in my Life</h2>
									<p>
										From an early age, my parents always made education a very huge emphasis in my
										life. Luckily, I have been blessed with great teachers that made learning
										exciting and fun. I learned very quickly, that math was a subject I was very
										adept in. I continued to excel in school all the way up until high school. In my
										freshman and sophomore year, certain events regarding family disorder took the
										importance of school from me. This is where I began to fall in my coursework.
										After going through these events, however, I came out as a very much stronger
										and better person. I began to really piece my future together from this point.
										Beginning my junior year, I was able to get my very first job, where I was
										working 30 hours a week (full time for minors). During this time, I was also
										taking AP Calculus I. My favorite and best teacher that I have ever had, Mr.
										Leven, gave me and other students an opportunity that has changed my life for
										the better. Through his endless support and help, we were allowed to
										independently study for the AP Calc II test, whilst enrolled in Calc I. By
										passing this test, I was able to take college level math (Multivariable Calculus
										and Elementary Linear Algebra) during my senior year of high school. Not only
										did this allow me to get a lot of college coursework out of the way, it also
										helped me realize exactly the opportunities that were always in front of me, and
										to find out exactly what I was capable of as long as I was determined enough. To
										pass this test, I studied endlessly until the test date came. I studied before
										school, in between school and work, and after work that ended at 10pm. Because
										of my lower GPA from failing classes in the beginning of college, I was rejected
										from the universities I had applied to. However, I decided to make the best of
										my situation, and go to my local community college and transfer to SDSU in a
										single year out of high school. From taking the college math courses in high
										school, I only needed to complete my general education to transfer. My first
										semester at San Diego Miramar College, I took 24 units (twice the amount for
										full time). I also took a course at Grossmont College for a total of 28 units
										that semester, while working part time at StateFarm and doing tutoring. Now I am
										currently attending SDSU, where I am keeping a GPA that will hopefully allow me
										to graduate with Magna Cum Laude. At SDSU, I have started a Computer Science
										Minor along with my Mathematics Major with an emphasis in Computational Science.
										From my experience with independently learning, I am also pursing learning more
										computer programming online. I am pursing independently learning about machine
										learning, hacking, and becoming a Full Stack Developer. The education doesn't
										stop however. I am planning on completing a Physics AS at San Diego Miramar
										College in 2022. From there, I know I will continuously be enrolled in school to
										continuously keep learning new things.

									<h2>Friends and its role in my Life</h2>
									<p>
										My family situation has never been the best. I find a lot of my comfort in my
										friends. Friends have always been there for me when I need them. This is kind of
										my Thank You to them. I have found my closest friends in some of the weirdest
										places. The friends that I think of as family are actually my co-workers from my
										night shifts at McDonald's. I truly love them as much as a person can love their
										family. My Managers, Jessica Whitlock and Yared Trinidad, taught me the values
										that I hold true to today. I very much think my success comes completely from
										them, because I wouldn't be the person I am today without them. My other friend
										group comes from some friends when I was on my high school's dance team. We had
										all danced together and still all stay connected in our busy lives to enjoy game
										nights, or for some dinner parties.Lastly, my last friend group are some great
										people I met whilst at SDSU. I loved our long nights studying at the SDSU love
										library. I have definitely been through the toughest classes and homework with
										these friends, and I hope our friendship lasts after college.

									<h2>Money and its role in my Life</h2>
									<p>
										Money has played a very active role in my life. Growing up, my family didn't
										have that much money, so we had to cut back on the luxuries of life a lot. It
										was the little things I think as a kid, that made me want money so much. For
										example, in school, I was always hungry because school lunch was never enough
										food. I never had snacks or lunch from home to keep me fueled. I remember always
										asking other students to share their food with me. I also remember the time,
										where on field trips, everyone always had Lunchables and I always had a bologna
										sandwich. Or just during recess, everyone had pokemon cards, and my dad would
										never buy me them. Another thing, I wanted so badly as a kid was either birthday
										money, Christmas money, or allowance money. Going into middle and high school, I
										remember never having money to go eat out with my friends. Its funny to think
										back and see all the things I wanted so badly as a kid. But these little
										memories is what drives me to getting to a state of financial independence. I
										never want to have opportunities closed because of a lack of money. I want to be
										able to live worry free of the thought of whether or not I have enough money. I
										got my very first "job" at the age of 14, cutting a neighbor's yard, and then I
										house sat at another neighbor's house for a few holidays. The instant I turned
										16, I got a job at McDonald's and truly experienced what it was like to have a
										full time job and be able to go out and eat, or buy cool tech stuff on Amazon.
										From there, I have had jobs at StateFarm, Tutor Doctor, and Spa Synergy. Pretty
										much from the 2016 to 2019, I was working a full time job, being a full time
										student, and tutoring at nights. This year (2020), I have decided to take a
										pause on the jobs to truly focus on finishing my degree. I do however, expect to
										fully dive back into the work field in 2021. Through all that hard work, I had
										saved about $20,000. Throughout highschool, I had been trying to independently
										learn about the Stock Market. This year, I started trading in the Stock Market,
										where I put $6,000 in an individual brokerage account and another $6,000 into a
										ROTH IRA. Using Schwab Intelligent Portfolios, my retirement plan has made about
										$550. Buying my own stocks, my individual account has made about $1,500.
										Understanding about money, I know the importance of investing at an early age,
										and especially starting a retirement plan as early as possible. I have been
										trying so hard to be smart with my money, all for one very big goal, to be a San
										Diego Home Owner by 2023 - 2025. From there, my goals will be to open up my own
										tutoring business, "Crossroads Tutoring", and to travel to two countries a year.

						Welcome to Crossroads Tutoring. Crossroads Tutoring is a small business tutoring company of mine
						with a single mission statement.
					</p>
					<h3>
						We show students who are at a Crossroads with themselves and their education, the opportunities
						that are available for them once they realize what they are capable of.
					</h3>
					<p>
						Crossroads tutoring is my own embodiment of my passion towards showing students the importance
						of taking hold of their education, and essentially their future. Tutoring shouldn't feel like
						school #2. What students should be getting out of tutoring is an excitement to learn and a
						passion to furthering their lives through education. Every student is different, such that every
						tutoring experience should be hand crafted by our tutors so it is the perfect environment to
						cultivate a new positive view towards learning. I believe that students cannot learn if they do
						not understand the importance of the topics, and if they are not having an enjoyable time with
						it. Every tutoring session needs to be personal, enjoyable, and focused.
						<br /><br />
						We promise at Crossroads Tutoring to always go above and beyond to every student that we make
						the commitment to tutoring. Every student that I have tutored has my phone number and email for
						any questions or help that they may need. I am dedicated to my students and will answer any
						questions of theres at any time of the day.
						<br /><br />
						If you are interested in tutoring or have any questions, please feel free to call, text, or
						email me. My contact information can be found above in the contact tab. If you choose to email
						or text, please include the course subject and what you are looking for from our tutoring
						services, so we may best understand you and your situation. Thank You So Much.

					<h1>Hello and Welcome!</h1>
					<p>
						This is my second time making a full fledged website. This website is a host for my Personal
						Projects along with simply anything I want to show to the world. I have really found a great
						passion in programming, especially the web development side of it, over the past 3 years. I love
						web development because its a way for me to make visualizations of my entire programming
						journey, instead of just printing statements. One thing, I very much struggle in is being
						creative.
						<a href="../Website-v.1.0/Home.html">My first website</a> was a raw website with hardly any
						design or styling, and was purely functional. This time, through the help of my friends for
						design purposes, I made this website entirely using Vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS. I already do know
						React Native, so I might be making a third version that is made through React. Please feel free
						to navigate through my website and contact me if you have any suggestions or would like to see
						anything regarding my website. I always have an open ear for ways to make my website more
						interactive and fun.

										<p>
											I met my family when I was 16 at McDonalds. While I worked at McDonalds, I
											made the best connections a person can make with my coworkers and managers.
											I have 2 mom's, my managers Jessica and Yared. These ladies raised me during
											a very touch time in my life. I was going through anger issues, had no
											motivation, and had no idea of a future. Jessica and Yared supported me ever
											since I have known them. Its because of these hardworking ladies, that I
											have the work ethic I have now. I am able to work 12 hours a day, and then
											do 6 hours of schoolwork. This work drive came from these amazing women in
											my life. Through them, I have also met more and more amazing people in my
											lfe and add to my family. I now have a baby sister, Alicee, who is Yared's
											daughter, and she is the coolest five year old, I could have ever met. I
											also have an aunt, Danielle, Jessica's Best Friend, who is someone who has
											always been a symbol for advise and wisdom for me. These people in my lfe
											make me feel like everything is possible as long as I put in the work and I
											know they will be there with me along my journey for every step. To these
											people, I know we met in the strangest place, but I honestly can not me more
											grateful to have such amazing people in my life.
										</p>

										<p>
											I also met my family during my time on Dance Team. While on my high school
											dance team, I met friends that I can gladly say will be a part of my life
											forever. I have someone that I think of as my best friend, Sam. She is
											someone who has been a part of my life and seen me grow in so many ways. She
											has been there through my toughest times as well as my best times. I can
											gladly say that we have each others back through thick and thin. She is
											someone that I find as a friendly competition in the race to financial
											independence, and someone who can challenge me there as well. I also met the
											funnest people I have ever hung out with. These people include my friends,
											Cedric, Dom, and Vincent. Cedric has always been the friend that cracks the
											best jokes and always has a great attitude when playing videogames or
											sports. Cedric has always been the friend to put me in check whenever I got
											out of line, and I respect him so much for that. Dom has always been the
											friend to have deep long conversations about ways to progress in life. Dom
											and I have seen each other's ups and downs, and I know he is someone I can
											rely on at any time of the day. I am so happy to see his journey studying
											hard to one day become a Supreme Court member. Vincent has always been the
											friend to listen. I have told him my entire life on multiple counts. He has
											been my barber for years now and I am so happy to see his journey trying to
											make a name for himself as a game developer.

									<h2>Education and its role in my Life</h2>
									<p>
										From an early age, my parents always made education a very huge emphasis in my
										life. Luckily, I have been blessed with great teachers that made learning
										exciting and fun. I learned very quickly that math was a subject I was very
										adept in. I continued to excel in school all the way up until high school. In my
										freshman and sophomore year, certain events regarding family disorder took the
										importance of school from me. This is where I began to fall in my coursework.
										After going through these events, however, I came out as a very much stronger
										and better person. I began to really piece my future together from this point.
										Beginning my junior year, I was able to get my very first job, where I was
										working 30 hours a week (full time for minors). During this time, I was also
										taking AP Calculus I. My favorite and best teacher that I have ever had, Mr.
										Leven, gave me and other students an opportunity that has changed my life for
										the better. Through his endless support and help, we were allowed to
										independently study for the AP Calculus II test, whilst enrolled in AP Calculus
										I. By passing this test, I was able to take college level math (Multivariable
										Calculus and Elementary Linear Algebra) during my senior year of high school.
										Not only did this allow me to get a lot of college coursework out of the way, it
										also helped me realize exactly the opportunities that were always in front of
										me, and to find out exactly what I was capable of as long as I was determined
										enough. To pass this test, I studied endlessly until the test date came. I
										studied before school, in between school and work, and after work that ended at
										10pm. Because of my lower GPA from failing classes in the beginning of high
										school, I was rejected from the universities I had applied to. However, I
										decided to make the best of my situation, and go to my local community college
										and transfer to SDSU in a single year out of high school. From taking the
										college math courses in high school, I only needed to complete my general
										education to transfer. My first semester at San Diego Miramar College, I took 24
										units (twice the amount for full time). I also took a course at Grossmont
										College for a total of 28 units that semester, while working part time at
										StateFarm and doing tutoring. I then was able to transfer into SDSU in a year,
										where I learned so much about working in groups and the power in cooperation.
										Very early at SDSU, I was told to find a good group of friends to do homework
										with and hold tight throughout my time at SDSU. I truly believe that working in
										groups and doing homework together is a huge reasons why i was able to do so
										well at SDSU. I ended up graduating SDSU in Magma Cum Laude with a 3.7 GPA. I
										look back at my education, and I believe that my education has taught me so much
										about how to keep working hard, how to learn on my feet, and about my own
										capabilities. I learned that I have so many opportunities in life, and as long
										as I can be "Comfortable being Uncomfortable" that the sky is the limit.

									<h2>Money and its role in my Life</h2>
									<p>
										Money has played a very active role in my life. Growing up, my family didn't
										have much money, so we had to cut back on the luxuries of life a lot. It was the
										little things I think as a kid, that made me want money so much. For example, in
										school, I was always hungry because school lunch was never enough food. I never
										had snacks or lunch from home to keep me fueled, so I would always ask other
										students to share their food with me. I also remember the time, where on field
										trips, everyone always had Lunchables and I always had a bologna sandwich, or
										just during recess, everyone had pokemon cards, and my dad would never buy me
										any. Another thing, I wanted so badly as a kid was either birthday money,
										Christmas money, or allowance money. Going into middle and high school, I
										remember never having money to go eat out with my friends. Its funny to think
										back and see all the things I wanted so badly as a kid. But these little
										memories is what drives me to getting to a state of financial independence. I
										never want to have opportunities closed because of a lack of money. I want to be
										able to live worry free of the thought of whether or not I have enough money. I
										got my very first "job" at the age of 14, cutting a neighbor's yard, and then I
										house sat at another neighbor's house for a few holidays. The instant I turned
										16, I got a job at McDonald's and truly experienced what it was like to have a
										full time job and be able to go out and eat, or buy cool tech stuff on Amazon.
										From there, I have had jobs at StateFarm, Tutor Doctor, Spa Synergy, and
										Tramigo. Pretty much from the year 2016 to 2019, I was working a full time job,
										being a full time student, and tutoring at nights. For the year 2020, I took
										some time off to focus on my education and to stay safe during the pandemic. It
										is now 2021 now. I have moved out of my parents' house and am now living in an
										apartment with my girlfriend and a friend of ours. I am working at Spa Synergy
										again and I am currently trying my hardest to reach my ultimate goal of putting
										a 20% down payment on a $500,000 house by the years 2023 - 2025. I currently
										have $10,000 in my savings, $13,000 in a brokerage account, $7,500 in a Roth
										IRA, and $650 in crypto currency. My goal of $100,000 in the next few years is
										so close. I plan to be smart wiht my money and truly push my work ethic to new
										heights, so I can one day say "I am a 23 year old homeowner!"

						<h2>Welcome to CrossRoads Tutoring</h2>
						<h3>Our Mission is to Challenge, Uplift, and Inspire Students.</h3>
						<p>
							CrossRoads Tutoring's Goal is to make a difference in every single one our student's lives.
							The way we want to do that is by showing each student the amount of opportunities they have
							when they put in the work. We tutor in all levels of Mathematics, Computer Science, along
							with SAT and ACT Preparation. Not only do we tutor in the basic subjects, we also teach ways
							for their education to be applied in the real world, such as college planning, job
							searching, and even optimized learning and test taking techniques. I have been tutoring
							since 2018, and I have been blessed to have such amazing students and I truly feel like I
							have made an impact in each of their lives. CrossRoads Tutoring is not School #2. What I
							mean when I say that, is that our tutoring is exciting, fun, and personal all while being
							effective and efficient. We understand that if the current formal school system isn't
							working for that student, then we find more personal ways to make our students excited for
							tutoring which leads to a better understanding of the material every single time. Every
							student is different, such that every tutoring experience should be personalized by our
							tutors so it is the perfect environment to cultivate a new positive view towards learning. I
							believe that students cannot learn if they do not understand the importance of the topics,
							and if they are not having an enjoyable time with it. I can ensure that every tutoring
							session is personal, enjoyable, and focused. We promise at Crossroads Tutoring to always go
							above and beyond to every student that we make the commitment to tutoring. Every student
							that I have tutored has my phone number and email for any questions or help that they may
							need. I am dedicated to my students and will answer any questions of theres at any time of
							the day. If you are interested in tutoring or have any questions, please feel free to call,
							text, or email me. My contact information can be found above in the contact tab. If you
							choose to email or text, please include the course subject and what you are looking for from
							our tutoring services, so we may best understand you and your situation. Thank You So Much.

				<h1>Who We Are</h1>
				<h3>
					Our Mission is to Challenge, Uplift, and Inspire Students. CrossRoads Tutoring's Goal is to make a
					difference in every single one of our student's lives. The way we achieve that is by showing each
					student the opportunities they have when they put in the effort. We tutor in all levels of
					Mathematics, Computer Science, along with SAT and ACT Preparation. Not only do we tutor in the basic
					subjects, we also teach ways for students to apply their education in the real world, including
					college planning, job searching, and even optimized learning with test taking techniques.
					<br />

					Stephen Giang (Owner):
					<blockquote>
						I have been tutoring since 2018, and I have been blessed to have such amazing students. I truly
						feel like I have made an impact in each of their lives. CrossRoads Tutoring is not School #2.
						Our tutoring is exciting, fun, and personal all while being effective and efficient. We
						understand that the current school system isn't working for every student, so we strive to find
						more personal ways to make our students excited for tutoring, leading to a better understanding
						of the material every single time. Every student is different, such that every tutoring
						experience should be personalized by our tutors so it is the perfect environment to cultivate a
						new positive view towards learning. I believe that students cannot learn if they do not
						understand the importance of the subjects, and if they are not having an enjoyable time with
						them. I can ensure that every tutoring session is personal, enjoyable, and focused. We promise
						at CrossRoads Tutoring to always go above and beyond for every student that we make the
						commitment to tutoring. Every student that I have tutored has my phone number and email for any
						questions or help that they may need. I am dedicated to my students and will answer any of their
						questions at any time of the day. If you are interested in tutoring or have any questions,
						please feel free to call, text, or email me. I also have a personal website to learn more about
						me at

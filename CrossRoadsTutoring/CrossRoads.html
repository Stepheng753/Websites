				<h1>Who We Are</h1>
				<h3>
					Our Mission is to Challenge, Uplift, and Inspire Students. CrossRoads Tutoring's Goal is to make a
					difference in every single one of our student's lives. The way we achieve that is by showing each
					student the amount of opportunities they have when they put in the work. We tutor in all levels of
					Mathematics, Computer Science, along with SAT and ACT Preparation. Not only do we tutor in the basic
					subjects, we also teach ways for their education to be applied in the real world, such as college
					planning, job searching, and even optimized learning with test taking techniques.
					<br />

					Stephen Giang (Owner):
					<blockquote>
						I have been tutoring since 2018, and I have been blessed to have such amazing students and I
						truly feel like I have made an impact in each of their lives. CrossRoads Tutoring is not School
						#2. Our tutoring is exciting, fun, and personal all while being effective and efficient. We
						understand that if the current formal school system isn't working for that student, then we find
						more personal ways to make our students excited for tutoring which leads to a better
						understanding of the material every single time. Every student is different, such that every
						tutoring experience should be personalized by our tutors so it is the perfect environment to
						cultivate a new positive view towards learning. I believe that students cannot learn if they do
						not understand the importance of the topics, and if they are not having an enjoyable time with
						it. I can ensure that every tutoring session is personal, enjoyable, and focused. We promise at
						CrossRoads Tutoring to always go above and beyond to every student that we make the commitment
						to tutoring. Every student that I have tutored has my phone number and email for any questions
						or help that they may need. I am dedicated to my students and will answer any of their questions
						at any time of the day. If you are interested in tutoring or have any questions, please feel
						free to call, text, or email me. I also have a personal website to learn more about me at
						<a href="../StephenG753/">StephenG753.com</a>. Thank You So Much.

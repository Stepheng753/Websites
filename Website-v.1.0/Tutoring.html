			<h1>Crossroads Tutoring</h1>

			<p id="Tutoring">
				Welcome to Crossroads Tutoring. Crossroads Tutoring is a small business tutoring company of mine with a
				single mission statement.
			</p>
			<h3 id="mstate">
				We show students who are at a Crossroads with themselves and their education, the opportunities that are
				available for them once they realize what they are capable of.

			<p id="Tutoring">
				Crossroads tutoring is my own embodiment of my passion towards showing students the importance of taking
				hold of their education, and essentially their future. Tutoring shouldn't feel like school #2. What
				students should be getting out of tutoring is an excitement to learn and a passion to furthering their
				lives through education. Every student is different, such that every tutoring experience should be hand
				crafted by our tutors so it is the perfect environment to cultivate a new positive view towards
				learning. I believe that students cannot learn if they do not understand the importance of the topics,
				and if they are not having an enjoyable time with it. Every tutoring session needs to be personal,
				enjoyable, and focused.
				<br /><br />
				We promise at Crossroads Tutoring to always go above and beyond to every student that we make the
				commitment to tutoring. Every student that I have tutored has my phone number and email for any
				questions or help that they may need. I am dedicated to my students and will answer any questions of
				theres at any time of the day.
				<br /><br />
				If you are interested in tutoring or have any questions, please feel free to call, text, or email me. My
				contact information can be found above in the contact tab. If you choose to email or text, please
				include the course subject and what you are looking for from our tutoring services, so we may best
				understand you and your situation. Thank You So Much.

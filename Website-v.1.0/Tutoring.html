				<h2>Welcome to CrossRoads Tutoring</h2>
				<h3>Our Mission is to Challenge, Uplift, and Inspire Students.</h3>
				<p>
					CrossRoads Tutoring's Goal is to make a difference in every single one our student's lives. The way
					we want to do that is by showing each student the amount of opportunities they have when they put in
					the work. We tutor in all levels of Mathematics, Computer Science, along with SAT and ACT
					Preparation. Not only do we tutor in the basic subjects, we also teach ways for their education to
					be applied in the real world, such as college planning, job searching, and even optimized learning
					and test taking techniques. I have been tutoring since 2018, and I have been blessed to have such
					amazing students and I truly feel like I have made an impact in each of their lives. CrossRoads
					Tutoring is not School #2. What I mean when I say that, is that our tutoring is exciting, fun, and
					personal all while being effective and efficient. We understand that if the current formal school
					system isn't working for that student, then we find more personal ways to make our students excited
					for tutoring which leads to a better understanding of the material every single time. Every student
					is different, such that every tutoring experience should be personalized by our tutors so it is the
					perfect environment to cultivate a new positive view towards learning. I believe that students
					cannot learn if they do not understand the importance of the topics, and if they are not having an
					enjoyable time with it. I can ensure that every tutoring session is personal, enjoyable, and
					focused. We promise at Crossroads Tutoring to always go above and beyond to every student that we
					make the commitment to tutoring. Every student that I have tutored has my phone number and email for
					any questions or help that they may need. I am dedicated to my students and will answer any
					questions of theres at any time of the day. If you are interested in tutoring or have any questions,
					please feel free to call, text, or email me. My contact information can be found above in the
					contact tab. If you choose to email or text, please include the course subject and what you are
					looking for from our tutoring services, so we may best understand you and your situation. Thank You
					So Much.

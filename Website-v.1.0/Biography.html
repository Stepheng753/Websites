			<h2>Education and its role in my Life</h2>
			<p>
				From an early age, my parents always made education a very huge emphasis in my life. Luckily, I have
				been blessed with great teachers that made learning exciting and fun. I learned very quickly, that math
				was a subject I was very adept in. I continued to excel in school all the way up until high school. In
				my freshman and sophomore year, certain events regarding family disorder took the importance of school
				from me. This is where I began to fall in my coursework. After going through these events, however, I
				came out as a very much stronger and better person. I began to really piece my future together from this
				point. Beginning my junior year, I was able to get my very first job, where I was working 30 hours a
				week (full time for minors). During this time, I was also taking AP Calculus I. My favorite and best
				teacher that I have ever had, Mr. Leven, gave me and other students an opportunity that has changed my
				life for the better. Through his endless support and help, we were allowed to independently study for
				the AP Calc II test, whilst enrolled in Calc I. By passing this test, I was able to take college level
				math (Multivariable Calculus and Elementary Linear Algebra) during my senior year of high school. Not
				only did this allow me to get a lot of college coursework out of the way, it also helped me realize
				exactly the opportunities that were always in front of me, and to find out exactly what I was capable of
				as long as I was determined enough. To pass this test, I studied endlessly until the test date came. I
				studied before school, in between school and work, and after work that ended at 10pm. Because of my
				lower GPA from failing classes in the beginning of college, I was rejected from the universities I had
				applied to. However, I decided to make the best of my situation, and go to my local community college
				and transfer to SDSU in a single year out of high school. From taking the college math courses in high
				school, I only needed to complete my general education to transfer. My first semester at San Diego
				Miramar College, I took 24 units (twice the amount for full time). I also took a course at Grossmont
				College for a total of 28 units that semester, while working part time at StateFarm and doing tutoring.
				Now I am currently attending SDSU, where I am keeping a GPA that will hopefully allow me to graduate
				with Magna Cum Laude. At SDSU, I have started a Computer Science Minor along with my Mathematics Major
				with an emphasis in Computational Science. From my experience with independently learning, I am also
				pursing learning more computer programming online. I am pursing independently learning about machine
				learning, hacking, and becoming a Full Stack Developer. The education doesn't stop however. I am
				planning on completing a Physics AS at San Diego Miramar College in 2022. From there, I know I will
				continuously be enrolled in school to continuously keep learning new things.

			<h2>Friends and its role in my Life</h2>
			<p>
				My family situation has never been the best. I find a lot of my comfort in my friends. Friends have
				always been there for me when I need them. This is kind of my Thank You to them. I have found my closest
				friends in some of the weirdest places. The friends that I think of as family are actually my co-workers
				from my night shifts at McDonald's. I truly love them as much as a person can love their family. My
				Managers, Jessica Whitlock and Yared Trinidad, taught me the values that I hold true to today. I very
				much think my success comes completely from them, because I wouldn't be the person I am today without
				them. My other friend group comes from some friends when I was on my high school's dance team. We had
				all danced together and still all stay connected in our busy lives to enjoy game nights, or for some
				dinner parties.Lastly, my last friend group are some great people I met whilst at SDSU. I loved our long
				nights studying at the SDSU love library. I have definitely been through the toughest classes and
				homework with these friends, and I hope our friendship lasts after college.

			<h2>Money and its role in my Life</h2>
			<p>
				Money has played a very active role in my life. Growing up, my family didn't have that much money, so we
				had to cut back on the luxuries of life a lot. It was the little things I think as a kid, that made me
				want money so much. For example, in school, I was always hungry because school lunch was never enough
				food. I never had snacks or lunch from home to keep me fueled. I remember always asking other students
				to share their food with me. I also remember the time, where on field trips, everyone always had
				Lunchables and I always had a bologna sandwich. Or just during recess, everyone had pokemon cards, and
				my dad would never buy me them. Another thing, I wanted so badly as a kid was either birthday money,
				Christmas money, or allowance money. Going into middle and high school, I remember never having money to
				go eat out with my friends. Its funny to think back and see all the things I wanted so badly as a kid.
				But these little memories is what drives me to getting to a state of financial independence. I never
				want to have opportunities closed because of a lack of money. I want to be able to live worry free of
				the thought of whether or not I have enough money. I got my very first "job" at the age of 14, cutting a
				neighbor's yard, and then I house sat at another neighbor's house for a few holidays. The instant I
				turned 16, I got a job at McDonald's and truly experienced what it was like to have a full time job and
				be able to go out and eat, or buy cool tech stuff on Amazon. From there, I have had jobs at StateFarm,
				Tutor Doctor, and Spa Synergy. Pretty much from the 2016 to 2019, I was working a full time job, being a
				full time student, and tutoring at nights. This year (2020), I have decided to take a pause on the jobs
				to truly focus on finishing my degree. I do however, expect to fully dive back into the work field in
				2021. Through all that hard work, I had saved about $20,000. Throughout highschool, I had been trying to
				independently learn about the Stock Market. This year, I started trading in the Stock Market, where I
				put $6,000 in an individual brokerage account and another $6,000 into a ROTH IRA. Using Schwab
				Intelligent Portfolios, my retirement plan has made about $550. Buying my own stocks, my individual
				account has made about $1,500. Understanding about money, I know the importance of investing at an early
				age, and especially starting a retirement plan as early as possible. I have been trying so hard to be
				smart with my money, all for one very big goal, to be a San Diego Home Owner by 2023 - 2025. From there,
				my goals will be to open up my own tutoring business, "Crossroads Tutoring", and to travel to two
				countries a year.

			<h2>Family and its role in my Life</h2>
			<p>
				I met my family when I was 16 at McDonalds. While I worked at McDonalds, I made the best connections a
				person can make with my coworkers and managers. I have 2 mom's, my managers Jessica and Yared. These
				ladies raised me during a very touch time in my life. I was going through anger issues, had no
				motivation, and had no idea of a future. Jessica and Yared supported me ever since I have known them.
				Its because of these hardworking ladies, that I have the work ethic I have now. I am able to work 12
				hours a day, and then do 6 hours of schoolwork. This work drive came from these amazing women in my
				life. Through them, I have also met more and more amazing people in my lfe and add to my family. I now
				have a baby sister, Alicee, who is Yared's daughter, and she is the coolest five year old, I could have
				ever met. I also have an aunt, Danielle, Jessica's Best Friend, who is someone who has always been a
				symbol for advise and wisdom for me. These people in my lfe make me feel like everything is possible as
				long as I put in the work and I know they will be there with me along my journey for every step. To
				these people, I know we met in the strangest place, but I honestly can not me more grateful to have such
				amazing people in my life.

			<h2>Education and its role in my Life</h2>
			<p>
				From an early age, my parents always made education a very huge emphasis in my life. Luckily, I have
				been blessed with great teachers that made learning exciting and fun. I learned very quickly that math
				was a subject I was very adept in. I continued to excel in school all the way up until high school. In
				my freshman and sophomore year, certain events regarding family disorder took the importance of school
				from me. This is where I began to fall in my coursework. After going through these events, however, I
				came out as a very much stronger and better person. I began to really piece my future together from this
				point. Beginning my junior year, I was able to get my very first job, where I was working 30 hours a
				week (full time for minors). During this time, I was also taking AP Calculus I. My favorite and best
				teacher that I have ever had, Mr. Leven, gave me and other students an opportunity that has changed my
				life for the better. Through his endless support and help, we were allowed to independently study for
				the AP Calculus II test, whilst enrolled in AP Calculus I. By passing this test, I was able to take
				college level math (Multivariable Calculus and Elementary Linear Algebra) during my senior year of high
				school. Not only did this allow me to get a lot of college coursework out of the way, it also helped me
				realize exactly the opportunities that were always in front of me, and to find out exactly what I was
				capable of as long as I was determined enough. To pass this test, I studied endlessly until the test
				date came. I studied before school, in between school and work, and after work that ended at 10pm.
				Because of my lower GPA from failing classes in the beginning of high school, I was rejected from the
				universities I had applied to. However, I decided to make the best of my situation, and go to my local
				community college and transfer to SDSU in a single year out of high school. From taking the college math
				courses in high school, I only needed to complete my general education to transfer. My first semester at
				San Diego Miramar College, I took 24 units (twice the amount for full time). I also took a course at
				Grossmont College for a total of 28 units that semester, while working part time at StateFarm and doing
				tutoring. I then was able to transfer into SDSU in a year, where I learned so much about working in
				groups and the power in cooperation. Very early at SDSU, I was told to find a good group of friends to
				do homework with and hold tight throughout my time at SDSU. I truly believe that working in groups and
				doing homework together is a huge reasons why i was able to do so well at SDSU. I ended up graduating
				SDSU in Magma Cum Laude with a 3.7 GPA. I look back at my education, and I believe that my education has
				taught me so much about how to keep working hard, how to learn on my feet, and about my own
				capabilities. I learned that I have so many opportunities in life, and as long as I can be "Comfortable
				being Uncomfortable" that the sky is the limit.

			<h2>Money and its role in my Life</h2>
			<p>
				Money has played a very active role in my life. Growing up, my family didn't have much money, so we had
				to cut back on the luxuries of life a lot. It was the little things I think as a kid, that made me want
				money so much. For example, in school, I was always hungry because school lunch was never enough food. I
				never had snacks or lunch from home to keep me fueled, so I would always ask other students to share
				their food with me. I also remember the time, where on field trips, everyone always had Lunchables and I
				always had a bologna sandwich, or just during recess, everyone had pokemon cards, and my dad would never
				buy me any. Another thing, I wanted so badly as a kid was either birthday money, Christmas money, or
				allowance money. Going into middle and high school, I remember never having money to go eat out with my
				friends. Its funny to think back and see all the things I wanted so badly as a kid. But these little
				memories is what drives me to getting to a state of financial independence. I never want to have
				opportunities closed because of a lack of money. I want to be able to live worry free of the thought of
				whether or not I have enough money. I got my very first "job" at the age of 14, cutting a neighbor's
				yard, and then I house sat at another neighbor's house for a few holidays. The instant I turned 16, I
				got a job at McDonald's and truly experienced what it was like to have a full time job and be able to go
				out and eat, or buy cool tech stuff on Amazon. From there, I have had jobs at StateFarm, Tutor Doctor,
				Spa Synergy, and Tramigo. Pretty much from the year 2016 to 2019, I was working a full time job, being a
				full time student, and tutoring at nights. For the year 2020, I took some time off to focus on my
				education and to stay safe during the pandemic. It is now 2021 now. I have moved out of my parents'
				house and am now living in an apartment with my girlfriend and a friend of ours. I am working at Spa
				Synergy again and I am currently trying my hardest to reach my ultimate goal of putting a 20% down
				payment on a $500,000 house by the years 2023 - 2025. I currently have $10,000 in my savings, $13,000 in
				a brokerage account, $7,500 in a Roth IRA, and $650 in crypto currency. My goal of $100,000 in the next
				few years is so close. I plan to be smart wiht my money and truly push my work ethic to new heights, so
				I can one day say "I am a 23 year old homeowner!"

			<h2>Welcome to my Very First Website!</h2>
			<p id="Intro">
				<h3>This is a plaaceholder for the mobile version of my actual website.  Please check out the Desktop Version for the full experience.</h3> This website is a host for my
				Personal Projects along with simply anything I want to show to the world. I have really found a great
				passion in programming, especially the web development side of it, over the past 3 years. I love web
				development because its a way for me to make visualizations of my entire programming journey, instead of
				just printing statements. One thing, I very much struggle in is being creative.
				This website is a raw website with hardly any design or
				styling, and is purely functional. This time, through the help of my friends for design purposes, I
				made my other website entirely using Vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS. I already do know React Native, so I might
				be making a third version that is made through React, that way the mobile and desktop version can be consistent. Please feel free to navigate through my website
				and contact me if you have any suggestions or would like to see anything regarding my website. I always
				have an open ear for ways to make my website more interactive and fun.
